# Music-Store-SQL-Project

In that project, I queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database held information about a music store. Throughout the project, I assisted the Chinook team in understanding the media available in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice details. To help with the queries, the schema for the Chinook Database was provided below. The schema showed the columns that linked tables together via the arrows.

The US market generates the highest revenue among other countries, with Canada being the second-highest revenue-generating country. Population plays a significant role in these revenue trends.

In 2012, the digital music store generated the highest revenue, surpassing $120 million, solely in the US. I believe there is a correlation between the recession in 2008 and the economy returning to normalcy in 2012.
